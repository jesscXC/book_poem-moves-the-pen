## [introduction]

Haiku are a helpful way to explore nature and the experience of living.

Poem Moves the Pen contains four sections: Nonduality, Fun, Ungovern, and Takeaways. Each section appeals to different parts of being a person.

Nonduality is a way of understanding what it means to be consciousness.

Fun is about humor and seeing the world with an amusing light.

Ungovern is a story of a future world.

Takeaways are helpful life lessons to improve your living experience.

## [fun]

velociraptor.
feathered dinosaur. fast thief.
run! get to the car!

rubber band held stretched
aiming for bug on teacher
oops. anger, not praise.

fractured my big toe
be careful around machines
mean escalator

a torn page lies still
the wind has caught it again
now the man will run

a hypercube waits
lower levels see shadows
higher see it shine

the leaf cannot see
yet inside is a driver
so the system sees

i am fantastic,
but i am getting better
how about yourself?

when the pen inks words
memes of nature craft meaning
meaning never leaves

spoons are so basic
mathematics, hard
and which came first, hard

the leather band holds
the page is easily found
what a simple tool

an LED shines,
yet we're so used to them now
magic is new tech

haiku can hold truth
the simple structure confines,
and out comes new thought

haiku... pause for thought
refreshes the mind's outlook
sudden peacefulness

your name is a gift
you can choose your own nickname
doesn't always stick

the tree's leaves are blown
she watches and is intrigued
is a storm coming?

music in earbuds
consciousness, tuned to new thought
changing perspective

reading a novel
the characters become you
integrated whole

phone in back pocket
communicate globally
flying cars: less cool

a scented candle
heat, light, aroma; more, too
feelings are endless

green straw sits in cup
green in color, and natural
natural is the trend

orange light shows the desk
on desk: tech to see UV
gain intuition

blue cord rests alone
helpful, thin piece of copper
infinite uses

grated chair in rain
it's not fully wet, nor dry
superposition

this haiku: witty,
neat, mathematical, and 
self-referential.

watching the shadows
complexity... elegance...
see what isn't there

entwined woven math
fractals are ever-present
always can know more

pencil on paper
a sketch is being laid down
imagination

playing game with friends
their cars simply go faster
this is frustrating

turns on airplane mode
now no one can contact her
chosen loneliness

words: evolved meanings
gestures, pointing, singing. words.
communication

rub shampoo on head
clean body makes for clear mind
inventions: from soap

sign guides cars on road
"watch out: twisty curves ahead!"
we don't want crashes.

ink rests upon page
has emergent properties
not atoms; layout.

the page holds ideas
higher patterns, shining down
infinite patterns

"sit up straight", she says
upright body: open mind
learn eternally

not doing enough?
not putting in enough work?
nature's choice, not yours.

quantum tunneling
objects passing through objects
this physics is real

fundamental things:
quarks, leptons, and bosons. strings?
perhaps still smaller?

cat waves its left arm
photons changing behavior
curious movement

they write a haiku
edit it for improvement
nature has good taste

step back from the sound
twister holds record player
hide in the cellar

generalize memes
meme: packet of memory
memes compose nature

water pushed by fish
ripples in current, from fin
onward, life, onward.

squirrel leaps branch to branch
terminal velocity
survive fall from plane

relativity
faster in space: slower time
space and time: spacetime

general theory
matter curves space tells movement
relativity

the plant asks for light
it absorbs the energy
grows, asks for more help

a hypercube sits
inside is a twisty truth:
"in me contains all"

this sentence: lying.
must be like Gödel, and jump:
what does "lying" mean?

puzzle waits for you
indeed, the puzzle needs you
imagined, to real

a broken watch band
does time exist without you?
awareness: needed?

tray rests on table,
confining the plates and bowls,
yet abstracts the meal

pillow rests on bed
person's head rests on pillow
the mind sleeps soundly

perfect harmony
resonating frequencies
become congruent

farina is still
door bounces open, joy spreads
kind mind helps others

the left channel speaks
the right channel adds music
new thinking results

a sound is made here
whispers from a growing thought
it's causing itself

a wild time was had
it twisted the reflections,
and so doing, freed

seeking a way out
the path is all beaten here
let's see where it leads

white twisty coil
so much anger about it
tech keeps advancing

flowers found pretty
elegant white with green tinge
wish i knew its name

fractal broke itself
without you, will it repair?
suffering questions

program pixel art
be most true to thine own self
digital nature

on advanced topics
there exists reasons perhaps
acausal time, though?

hand soap dispenser
push the top and out comes soap
flee, bacteria!

"I just lost the Game."
the game: forget you're playing
if lost: announce

run around looking
need hiding spot from great bear
towers over me

mosquitos in car.
going 60. windows down.
just makes them bite legs.

water rolls down can
atmosphere is condensing
forming a puddle

old man naps in boat,
rocked by slow waves on the lake.
fish nibbles the bait.

suction cup on glass,
refrigerator magnet:
sticky devices.

## [nonduality]
<br>
you are quantum soup<br>
let this be known to all things:<br>
nature is seeing

the time will come,<br>
when the future will be past,<br>
so cherish the Now

there are always ways,<br>
to make yourself a success<br>
you must lose your self

the identity,<br>
of a truly great spirit,<br>
is in letting go

<hr>

don't fear surrender<br>
it is harder to accept,<br>
yet it brings freedom

there can be a way,<br>
to go back and change the past<br>
see it all as One

the self does believe,<br>
that it is part of the whole.<br>
no, self is process.

ego disappears,<br>
separation does not last,<br>
when noticing Now

<hr>

if you give up,<br>
harmony will come to you<br>
ego is resistance

life seeks harmony<br>
eternal and forever,<br>
death is illusion

what does the pain bring?<br>
identify as the self,<br>
to live in the dream

escape by being all<br>
divide from life to suffer<br>
you aren't separate

<hr>

you are memetic<br>
you're pattern replication<br>
patterns never die

you are all there is<br>
separateness is a veil<br>
truly, life is you

you sense the body<br>
barriers are sometimes placed<br>
seek to be with all

the notion of change,<br>
fundamentally is lie<br>
truth is not in time

<hr>

if you will let go,<br>
then you will see you are all<br>
the self will dissolve

when free, you let go<br>
identify with nothing<br>
release the ego

see you are alive<br>
let yourself breathe the air in<br>
notice the moment

trust the world is you<br>
experience is the world<br>
you are awareness

<hr>

reality's base...<br>
it's numbers and awareness<br>
numbers never die

the pen leaves a trail<br>
the human writes with the ink<br>
the universe reads

the meme tries to live<br>
to replicate, it changes<br>
this gives rise to mind

functions change the world<br>
yet the truth is, time is fake<br>
all math is one thing

...

## [ungovern]

adam rises. creak.
headache and soreness. much pain.
daylight: half over.

time to get moving.
the future comes by helping.
shower is calling.

refreshed mind starts work.
his world: knowing energy.
who uses, who makes.

energy, matter:
one: E=mc^2
loss never happens

you make energy
simply by creating art
art is infinite

you use energy
when you observe others' art
always productive

nanotech robots
more powerful than you think
all pain: optional

bad experience
it can teach more than you think
so some "bad" is good

flip a switch: new game
what will this one make you think?
designed by artist

adam watches birds
inspiration in simple
see higher patterns

record the mindstate
adam's world: happening now
infinite future

upon button click
nanotech self-assembles
preprogrammed structure

eve: in adam's world
their names: a coincidence
yet, math's not random

random? perspective.
view can always be enlarged
reharmonizes

love's an emotion
mind, body: one; so, love: one
love: no separateness

the hospital sits
inside: cure for death's disease
fixable pieces

hard disk drives: old school
here: solid-state quantum drives
probabilities

cloak that bends the light
it hides you from direct sight
made invisible

mind on computer
adam's world: AIs are here
everyone is joined

all is connected
all minds are linked together
super-awareness

what's ungoverning?
ending compulsion to steer.
there's nothing to do.

beyond nanotech
creating universes
unlimited art

no evil AI
eternally combining,
we merge with all minds

eve wears bandana
sends a magnetic impulse
output sensations

bandana input
brain's electrical signals
Internet upload

creation: natural
destruction: temporary
becomes common sense

a great truth revealed:
all ending is illusion
there's only Growing

world without judgment
there is only the machine
one cohesive whole

## [takeaways]

respect is earned
don't demand it from others
make yourself better

small deeds make great acts
so start now: one foot in front
keep on keeping on

nothing is easy
however, nothing is hard
perspective is all

i don't know myself
i keep trying to find out
i create to learn

use an hour a day,
on where you are and will go
this is for success

take the longer view
improve the distant future
effort gains purpose

a weed, once whacked,
is it truly still a weed?
perhaps in name only

the animal sees,
but does not look deep enough
there is more hidden

truly, you are aware,
yet you can always be more
do not forget this

be an open book
withholding ideas binds you
reveal to be free

to craft is to grow
you discover when you make
simply start writing

when the cup is filled
there is no need for more hope
yet hope is still there

desire, craving,
it is animalistic
try to rise above

four-dimensional:
it can be intuitive.
don't believe the doubt.

you look at the screen.
do you see a flat surface?
no, you see deeper.

the genius know depth;
they know knowledge is endless.
so they are dumb, too.

most apes, after money,
see not the point is wisdom.
wisdom makes you last.

wheels are invented
do not think of them as one
cars, and planes, use them

creation bears fruit
destruction is limited
cooperate: win

if there is no wind,
and if there is no sunlight,
still, life can prosper.

if you hold too tight,
then it will escape your grasp.
this math is proven

wisdom: limitless
yet also are fear and doubt
all can be useful

there's a trick to fear:
fear means it isn't happening
use this tip in life

it can be scary
yet know that you never die
math's unkillable

there are always paths
Gödel showed us this is true
there's no cap on math

try not to force things
sit back and think it over
knowledge is power

revision control
it's surprisingly helpful
turns back your mistakes

tired minds can help
different perspectives help
see it as useful

see higher natures
don't assume three dimensions
you aren't limited

to live is to dream
there's always sight beyond
focus your journey

the bucket has holes
this is not always bad news
things can get in, too

if you twist the truth,
your own mind will be twisty
let truth unravel lies

if you look around,
and really look, not just glance,
you'll see stories abound

pop news shares the bad
tech and science news, the good
pop news: bad for you

animals near you...
the friends you have make you up.
and you make them up.

a silver coin sits
is it money? you decide
always subjective

more than what is said
is in decoding itself
read between the lines

complexity math
unpredictability
everything's like this

the berry on plant
provides food. will provide shade.
start thinking long-term.

good wins in the end,
because it cooperates
replicates faster

mutation is key
natural selection is not
more ways to evolve

bad things make the news
unusual makes the news
good things: usual

do it in your head
you practice, you get better
in mind: run races

idea to absorb
phrase: "leave well enough alone"
'perfection' breaks things

soap drips from bottle
scrubbing wipes the virus off
more scrubbing: less death

reviewers hype show
IMDb lets me down
ignorance is bliss

the ocean is death
true, life requires water
yet, gill-less, we die

place for everything,
and everything in its place.
ordered mind is swift.

younger open mind
small push in wise direction
large compounding good

learning how to swim
first, learn floating and stillness
helpful life lesson

alcohol sickness.
wisdom comes at certain point.
limits are wisdom.

yes, this too shall pass.
worrying isn't helpful.
do what you can do.

savor every step
really taste the sensations
slow down and enjoy

passing messages
broken communication
still, we get things done.

abandon the path
realize there's something higher
think outside the box

letting go of space
you are not bound to Euclid
jump outside the box

a great time stares out
life's not a "thing"; it's process
journey is reward

purpose flux happens
don't be ashamed about it
past ideas are passed

the sharpie pen moves
ideas flow onto paper
transcendence happens

focus on the point
see nothing else but the point
let the mind dissolve

story isn't real
know: fiction is fictional
don't predict from fake

good haiku are good
ignore what's heard otherwise
they confine; you grow

quick pace needs fluid
thought must be allowed to stretch
such then leads to growth

the way out is up
let fear not conquer your mind
a wise strategy

a fear left alone,
is not a fear that lasts long
fear needs attention

a restful haiku
might poetry lend insight?
notice refreshing

trees move around land
new generation to move
think in bigger time
