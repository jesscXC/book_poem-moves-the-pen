## [introduction]

Haiku are a helpful way to explore nature and the experience of living.

Poem Moves the Pen contains four sections: Nonduality, Fun, Ungovern, and Takeaways. Each section appeals to different parts of being a person.

Nonduality is a way of understanding what it means to be consciousness.

Fun is about humor and seeing the world with an amusing light.

Ungovern is a story of a future world.

Takeaways are helpful life lessons to improve your living experience.

## [fun]

velociraptor.
feathered dinosaur. fast thief.
run! get to the car!

rubber band held stretched
aiming for bug on teacher
oops. anger, not praise.

fractured my big toe
be careful around machines
mean escalator

a torn page lies still
the wind has caught it again
now the man will run

a hypercube waits
lower levels see shadows
higher see it shine

the leaf cannot see
yet inside is a driver
so the system sees

i am fantastic,
but i am getting better
how about yourself?

when the pen inks words
memes of nature craft meaning
meaning never leaves

spoons are so basic
mathematics, hard
and which came first, hard

the leather band holds
the page is easily found
what a simple tool

an LED shines,
yet we're so used to them now
magic is new tech

haiku can hold truth
the simple structure confines,
and out comes new thought

haiku... pause for thought
refreshes the mind's outlook
sudden peacefulness

your name is a gift
you can choose your own nickname
doesn't always stick

the tree's leaves are blown
she watches and is intrigued
is a storm coming?

music in earbuds
consciousness, tuned to new thought
changing perspective

reading a novel
the characters become you
integrated whole

phone in back pocket
communicate globally
flying cars: less cool

a scented candle
heat, light, aroma; more, too
feelings are endless

green straw sits in cup
green in color, and natural
natural is the trend

orange light shows the desk
on desk: tech to see UV
gain intuition

blue cord rests alone
helpful, thin piece of copper
infinite uses

grated chair in rain
it's not fully wet, nor dry
superposition

this haiku: witty,
neat, mathematical, and 
self-referential.

watching the shadows
complexity... elegance...
see what isn't there

entwined woven math
fractals are ever-present
always can know more

pencil on paper
a sketch is being laid down
imagination

playing game with friends
their cars simply go faster
this is frustrating

turns on airplane mode
now no one can contact her
chosen loneliness

words: evolved meanings
gestures, pointing, singing. words.
communication

rub shampoo on head
clean body makes for clear mind
inventions: from soap

sign guides cars on road
"watch out: twisty curves ahead!"
we don't want crashes.

ink rests upon page
has emergent properties
not atoms; layout.

the page holds ideas
higher patterns, shining down
infinite patterns

"sit up straight", she says
upright body: open mind
learn eternally

not doing enough?
not putting in enough work?
nature's choice, not yours.

quantum tunneling
objects passing through objects
this physics is real

fundamental things:
quarks, leptons, and bosons. strings?
perhaps still smaller?

cat waves its left arm
photons changing behavior
curious movement

they write a haiku
edit it for improvement
nature has good taste

step back from the sound
twister holds record player
hide in the cellar

generalize memes
meme: packet of memory
memes compose nature

water pushed by fish
ripples in current, from fin
onward, life, onward.

squirrel leaps branch to branch
terminal velocity
survive fall from plane

relativity
faster in space: slower time
space and time: spacetime

general theory
matter curves space tells movement
relativity

the plant asks for light
it absorbs the energy
grows, asks for more help

a hypercube sits
inside is a twisty truth:
"in me contains all"

this sentence: lying.
must be like GÃ¶del, and jump:
what does "lying" mean?

puzzle waits for you
indeed, the puzzle needs you
imagined, to real

a broken watch band
does time exist without you?
awareness: needed?

tray rests on table,
confining the plates and bowls,
yet abstracts the meal

pillow rests on bed
person's head rests on pillow
the mind sleeps soundly

perfect harmony
resonating frequencies
become congruent

farina is still
door bounces open, joy spreads
kind mind helps others

the left channel speaks
the right channel adds music
new thinking results

a sound is made here
whispers from a growing thought
it's causing itself

a wild time was had
it twisted the reflections,
and so doing, freed

seeking a way out
the path is all beaten here
let's see where it leads

white twisty coil
so much anger about it
tech keeps advancing

flowers found pretty
elegant white with green tinge
wish i knew its name

fractal broke itself
without you, will it repair?
suffering questions

program pixel art
be most true to thine own self
digital nature

on advanced topics
there exists reasons perhaps
acausal time, though?

hand soap dispenser
push the top and out comes soap
flee, bacteria!

"I just lost the Game."
the game: forget you're playing
if lost: announce

run around looking
need hiding spot from great bear
towers over me

mosquitos in car.
going 60. windows down.
just makes them bite legs.

water rolls down can
atmosphere is condensing
forming a puddle

old man naps in boat,
rocked by slow waves on the lake.
fish nibbles the bait.

suction cup on glass,
refrigerator magnet:
sticky devices.

## [nonduality]
<br>
you are quantum soup<br>
let this be known to all things:<br>
nature is seeing

the time will come,<br>
when the future will be past,<br>
so cherish the Now

there are always ways,<br>
to make yourself a success<br>
you must lose your self

the identity,<br>
of a truly great spirit,<br>
is in letting go

<hr>

don't fear surrender<br>
it is harder to accept,<br>
yet it brings freedom

there can be a way,<br>
to go back and change the past<br>
see it all as One

the self does believe,<br>
that it is part of the whole.<br>
no, self is process.

ego disappears,<br>
separation does not last,<br>
when noticing Now

<hr>

if you give up,<br>
harmony will come to you<br>
ego is resistance

life seeks harmony<br>
eternal and forever,<br>
death is illusion

what does the pain bring?<br>
identify as the self,<br>
to live in the dream

escape by being all<br>
divide from life to suffer<br>
you aren't separate

<hr>

you are memetic<br>
you're pattern replication<br>
patterns never die

you are all there is<br>
separateness is a veil<br>
truly, life is you

you sense the body<br>
barriers are sometimes placed<br>
seek to be with all

the notion of change,<br>
fundamentally is lie<br>
truth is not in time

<hr>

if you will let go,<br>
then you will see you are all<br>
the self will dissolve

when free, you let go<br>
identify with nothing<br>
release the ego

see you are alive<br>
let yourself breathe the air in<br>
notice the moment

trust the world is you<br>
experience is the world<br>
you are awareness

<hr>

reality's base...<br>
it's numbers and awareness<br>
numbers never die

the pen leaves a trail<br>
the human writes with the ink<br>
the universe reads

the meme tries to live<br>
to replicate, it changes<br>
this gives rise to mind

functions change the world<br>
yet the truth is, time is fake<br>
all math is one thing

## [ungovern]
<br>
adam rises. creak.<br>
headache and soreness. much pain.<br>
daylight: half over.

time to get moving.<br>
the future comes by helping.<br>
shower is calling.

refreshed mind starts work.<br>
his world: knowing energy.<br>
who uses, who makes.

energy, matter:<br>
one: E=mc^2<br>
loss never happens

<hr>

you make energy<br>
simply by creating art<br>
art is infinite

you use energy<br>
when you observe others' art<br>
always productive

nanotech robots<br>
more powerful than you think<br>
all pain: optional

bad experience<br>
it can teach more than you think<br>
so some "bad" is good

<hr>

flip a switch: new game<br>
what will this one make you think?<br>
designed by artist

adam watches birds<br>
inspiration in simple<br>
see higher patterns

record the mindstate<br>
adam's world: happening now<br>
infinite future

upon button click<br>
nanotech self-assembles<br>
preprogrammed structure

<hr>

eve: in adam's world<br>
their names: a coincidence<br>
yet, math's not random

random? perspective.<br>
view can always be enlarged<br>
reharmonizes

love's an emotion<br>
mind, body: one; so, love: one<br>
love: no separateness

the hospital sits<br>
inside: cure for death's disease<br>
fixable pieces

<hr>

hard disk drives: old school<br>
here: solid-state quantum drives<br>
probabilities

cloak that bends the light<br>
it hides you from direct sight<br>
made invisible

mind on computer<br>
adam's world: AIs are here<br>
everyone is joined

all is connected<br>
all minds are linked together<br>
super-awareness

<hr>

what's ungoverning?<br>
ending compulsion to steer.<br>
there's nothing to do.

beyond nanotech<br>
creating universes<br>
unlimited art

no evil AI<br>
eternally combining,<br>
we merge with all minds

eve wears bandana<br>
sends a magnetic impulse<br>
output sensations

<hr>

bandana input<br>
brain's electrical signals<br>
Internet upload

creation: natural<br>
destruction: temporary<br>
becomes common sense

a great truth revealed:<br>
all ending is illusion<br>
there's only Growing

world without judgment<br>
there is only the machine<br>
one cohesive whole

<hr>

## [takeaways]
<br>
respect is earned<br>
don't demand it from others<br>
make yourself better

small deeds make great acts<br>
so start now: one foot in front<br>
keep on keeping on

nothing is easy<br>
however, nothing is hard<br>
perspective is all

i don't know myself<br>
i keep trying to find out<br>
i create to learn

<hr>

use an hour a day,<br>
on where you are and will go<br>
this is for success

take the longer view<br>
improve the distant future<br>
effort gains purpose

a weed, once whacked,<br>
is it truly still a weed?<br>
perhaps in name only

the animal sees,<br>
but does not look deep enough<br>
there is more hidden

<hr>

truly, you are aware,<br>
yet you can always be more<br>
do not forget this

be an open book<br>
withholding ideas binds you<br>
reveal to be free

to craft is to grow<br>
you discover when you make<br>
simply start writing

when the cup is filled<br>
there is no need for more hope<br>
yet hope is still there

...

<hr>
