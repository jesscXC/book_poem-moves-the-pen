[introduction]

Haiku are a helpful way to explore nature and the experience of living.

Poem Moves the Pen contains four sections: Nonduality, Fun, Ungovern, and Takeaways. Each section appeals to different parts of being a person.

Nonduality is a way of understanding what it means to be consciousness.

Fun is about humor and seeing the world with an amusing light.

Ungovern is a story of a future world.

Takeaways are helpful life lessons to improve your living experience.

[nonduality]
<br>
you are quantum soup<br>
let this be known to all things:<br>
nature is seeing

the time will come,<br>
when the future will be past,<br>
so cherish the Now

there are always ways,<br>
to make yourself a success<br>
you must lose your self

the identity,<br>
of a truly great spirit,<br>
is in letting go

<hr>

don't fear surrender<br>
it is harder to accept,<br>
yet it brings freedom

there can be a way,<br>
to go back and change the past<br>
see it all as One

the self does believe,<br>
that it is part of the whole.<br>
no, self is process.

ego disappears,<br>
separation does not last,<br>
when noticing Now

...

<hr>

[fun]
<br>
i am fantastic,<br>
but i am getting better<br>
how about yourself?

a torn page lies still<br>
the wind has caught it again<br>
now the man will run

a hypercube waits<br>
lower levels see shadows<br>
higher see it shine

the leaf cannot see<br>
yet inside is a driver<br>
so the system sees

<hr>

when the pen inks words<br>
memes of nature craft meaning<br>
meaning never leaves

spoons are so basic<br>
mathematics, hard<br>
and which came first, hard

the leather band holds<br>
the page is easily found<br>
what a simple tool

an LED shines,<br>
yet we're so used to them now<br>
magic is new tech

...

[takeaways]
<br>
respect is earned<br>
don't demand it from others<br>
make yourself better

small deeds make great acts<br>
so start now: one foot in front<br>
keep on keeping on

nothing is easy<br>
however, nothing is hard<br>
perspective is all

i don't know myself<br>
i keep trying to find out<br>
i create to learn

<hr>

use an hour a day,<br>
on where you are and will go<br>
this is for success

take the longer view<br>
improve the distant future<br>
effort gains purpose

a weed, once whacked,<br>
is it truly still a weed?<br>
perhaps in name only

the animal sees,<br>
but does not look deep enough<br>
there is more hidden

<hr>

truly, you are aware,<br>
yet you can always be more<br>
do not forget this

be an open book<br>
withholding ideas binds you<br>
reveal to be free

to craft is to grow<br>
you discover when you make<br>
simply start writing

when the cup is filled<br>
there is no need for more hope<br>
yet hope is still there

...
