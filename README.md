## [introduction]

Haiku are a helpful way to explore nature and the experience of living.

Poem Moves the Pen contains four sections: Nonduality, Fun, Ungovern, and Takeaways. Each section appeals to different parts of being a person.

Nonduality is a way of understanding what it means to be consciousness.

Fun is about humor and seeing the world with an amusing light.

Ungovern is a story of a future world.

Takeaways are helpful life lessons to improve your living experience.

## [fun]

velociraptor.<br>
feathered dinosaur. fast thief.<br>
run! get to the car!

rubber band held stretched<br>
aiming for bug on teacher<br>
oops. anger, not praise.

fractured my big toe<br>
be careful around machines<br>
mean escalator

a torn page lies still<br>
the wind has caught it again<br>
now the man will run

a hypercube waits<br>
lower levels see shadows<br>
higher see it shine

the leaf cannot see<br>
yet inside is a driver<br>
so the system sees

i am fantastic,<br>
but i am getting better<br>
how about yourself?

when the pen inks words<br>
memes of nature craft meaning<br>
meaning never leaves

spoons are so basic<br>
mathematics, hard<br>
and which came first, hard

the leather band holds<br>
the page is easily found<br>
what a simple tool

an LED shines,<br>
yet we're so used to them now<br>
magic is new tech

haiku can hold truth<br>
the simple structure confines,<br>
and out comes new thought

haiku... pause for thought<br>
refreshes the mind's outlook<br>
sudden peacefulness

your name is a gift<br>
you can choose your own nickname<br>
doesn't always stick

the tree's leaves are blown<br>
she watches and is intrigued<br>
is a storm coming?

music in earbuds<br>
consciousness, tuned to new thought<br>
changing perspective

reading a novel<br>
the characters become you<br>
integrated whole

phone in back pocket<br>
communicate globally<br>
flying cars: less cool

a scented candle<br>
heat, light, aroma; more, too<br>
feelings are endless

green straw sits in cup<br>
green in color, and natural<br>
natural is the trend

orange light shows the desk<br>
on desk: tech to see UV<br>
gain intuition

blue cord rests alone<br>
helpful, thin piece of copper<br>
infinite uses

grated chair in rain<br>
it's not fully wet, nor dry<br>
superposition

this haiku: witty,<br>
neat, mathematical, and <br>
self-referential.

watching the shadows<br>
complexity... elegance...<br>
see what isn't there

entwined woven math<br>
fractals are ever-present<br>
always can know more

pencil on paper<br>
a sketch is being laid down<br>
imagination

playing game with friends<br>
their cars simply go faster<br>
this is frustrating

turns on airplane mode<br>
now no one can contact her<br>
chosen loneliness

words: evolved meanings<br>
gestures, pointing, singing. words.<br>
communication

rub shampoo on head<br>
clean body makes for clear mind<br>
inventions: from soap

sign guides cars on road<br>
"watch out: twisty curves ahead!"<br>
we don't want crashes.

ink rests upon page<br>
has emergent properties<br>
not atoms; layout.

the page holds ideas<br>
higher patterns, shining down<br>
infinite patterns

"sit up straight", she says<br>
upright body: open mind<br>
learn eternally

not doing enough?<br>
not putting in enough work?<br>
nature's choice, not yours.

quantum tunneling<br>
objects passing through objects<br>
this physics is real

fundamental things:<br>
quarks, leptons, and bosons. strings?<br>
perhaps still smaller?

cat waves its left arm<br>
photons changing behavior<br>
curious movement

they write a haiku<br>
edit it for improvement<br>
nature has good taste

step back from the sound<br>
twister holds record player<br>
hide in the cellar

generalize memes<br>
meme: packet of memory<br>
memes compose nature

water pushed by fish<br>
ripples in current, from fin<br>
onward, life, onward.

squirrel leaps branch to branch<br>
terminal velocity<br>
survive fall from plane

relativity<br>
faster in space: slower time<br>
space and time: spacetime

general theory<br>
matter curves space tells movement<br>
relativity

the plant asks for light<br>
it absorbs the energy<br>
grows, asks for more help

a hypercube sits<br>
inside is a twisty truth:<br>
"in me contains all"

this sentence: lying.<br>
must be like Gödel, and jump:<br>
what does "lying" mean?

puzzle waits for you<br>
indeed, the puzzle needs you<br>
imagined, to real

a broken watch band<br>
does time exist without you?<br>
awareness: needed?

tray rests on table,<br>
confining the plates and bowls,<br>
yet abstracts the meal

pillow rests on bed<br>
person's head rests on pillow<br>
the mind sleeps soundly

perfect harmony<br>
resonating frequencies<br>
become congruent

farina is still<br>
door bounces open, joy spreads<br>
kind mind helps others

the left channel speaks<br>
the right channel adds music<br>
new thinking results

a sound is made here<br>
whispers from a growing thought<br>
it's causing itself

a wild time was had<br>
it twisted the reflections,<br>
and so doing, freed

seeking a way out<br>
the path is all beaten here<br>
let's see where it leads

white twisty coil<br>
so much anger about it<br>
tech keeps advancing

flowers found pretty<br>
elegant white with green tinge<br>
wish i knew its name

fractal broke itself<br>
without you, will it repair?<br>
suffering questions

program pixel art<br>
be most true to thine own self<br>
digital nature

on advanced topics<br>
there exists reasons perhaps<br>
acausal time, though?

hand soap dispenser<br>
push the top and out comes soap<br>
flee, bacteria!

"I just lost the Game."<br>
the game: forget you're playing<br>
if lost: announce

run around looking<br>
need hiding spot from great bear<br>
towers over me

mosquitos in car.<br>
going 60. windows down.<br>
just makes them bite legs.

water rolls down can<br>
atmosphere is condensing<br>
forming a puddle

old man naps in boat,<br>
rocked by slow waves on the lake.<br>
fish nibbles the bait.

suction cup on glass,<br>
refrigerator magnet:<br>
sticky devices.

## [nonduality]

you are quantum soup<br>
let this be known to all things:<br>
nature is seeing

the time will come,<br>
when the future will be past,<br>
so cherish the Now

there are always ways,<br>
to make yourself a success<br>
you must lose your self

the identity,<br>
of a truly great spirit,<br>
is in letting go

don't fear surrender<br>
it is harder to accept,<br>
yet it brings freedom

there can be a way,<br>
to go back and change the past<br>
see it all as One

the self does believe,<br>
that it is part of the whole.<br>
no, self is process.

ego disappears,<br>
separation does not last,<br>
when noticing Now

if you give up,<br>
harmony will come to you<br>
ego is resistance

life seeks harmony<br>
eternal and forever,<br>
death is illusion

what does the pain bring?<br>
identify as the self,<br>
to live in the dream

escape by being all<br>
divide from life to suffer<br>
you aren't separate

you are memetic<br>
you're pattern replication<br>
patterns never die

you are all there is<br>
separateness is a veil<br>
truly, life is you

you sense the body<br>
barriers are sometimes placed<br>
seek to be with all

the notion of change,<br>
fundamentally is lie<br>
truth is not in time

if you will let go,<br>
then you will see you are all<br>
the self will dissolve

when free, you let go<br>
identify with nothing<br>
release the ego

see you are alive<br>
let yourself breathe the air in<br>
notice the moment

trust the world is you<br>
experience is the world<br>
you are awareness

reality's base...<br>
it's numbers and awareness<br>
numbers never die

the pen leaves a trail<br>
the human writes with the ink<br>
the universe reads

the meme tries to live<br>
to replicate, it changes<br>
this gives rise to mind

functions change the world<br>
yet the truth is, time is fake<br>
all math is one thing

when it comes, time tells<br>
that is because time is change<br>
time is required

when the mind seeks love,<br>
sought is separation, gone<br>
accept to feel it

let go of the sought<br>
you're code, processing itself<br>
the code is data

separation lies<br>
it's needed for memes to work<br>
memes are all one, though

information spreads<br>
packets, communicating,<br>
replicate themselves

the seeker is sought<br>
they are two sides of a coin<br>
one is the other

the speakers of truth,<br>
they have no need to mislead<br>
they set themselves free

we want to know more<br>
it never ends, this searching<br>
first, take a deep breath

being is loving<br>
to resist is to be blind<br>
accept, and love comes

this moment holds you<br>
look at it with baby eyes<br>
let yourself feel peace

memes are what make you<br>
you move, you think, you are, memes<br>
don't fear; you're nature

a notebook is held<br>
both with hand and with pillow<br>
universe holds, too

stop seeing as you<br>
the ego holds no answers<br>
start seeing as all

still your body, now<br>
notice you are not conscious<br>
you do not exist

patterns are running<br>
sometimes they seem separate<br>
you're a collection

ego will return<br>
do not view this as a fault<br>
instead, accept, now

nonduality<br>
also, transcendentalism<br>
they help you dissolve

begin wordlooping<br>
dissolve your ego in words<br>
see the relations

notice bits flipping<br>
see how memes rub off on others<br>
good ideas, spreading

when you look around,<br>
you might see separation,<br>
but you're all that is

being aware spreads<br>
awareness is all one thing<br>
no separation

knowledge has levels<br>
awakeness is leveled, too<br>
they aren't concrete, though

the mind can be still,<br>
then the ego will dissolve<br>
separation fades

awareness' ground,<br>
truthfully, it's infinite<br>
you will continue

stare at this one spot<br>
letting your awareness rest,<br>
realize you are all

time is illusion,<br>
yet mind requires changes<br>
static fields don't see

the way is broken,<br>
when the ego tries to fight<br>
instead, absorb peace

a time will soon come,<br>
where the mind will reach freedom<br>
let it happen now

there's a way to be,<br>
without suffering<br>
stop and breathe your mind

dissolve the ego<br>
simply surrender to now<br>
accept; don't resist

what is can be changed<br>
you do not do the changing<br>
nature is choosing

inner peace can come<br>
rise above the resistance<br>
your ego isn't real

there is a way out<br>
it involves using your mind<br>
transcend to the Now

to hold onto fear,<br>
the self must be resisting<br>
watch. dissolve the self.

the path is stillness<br>
watch the bits of nature flip<br>
see the self dissolve

time changes itself<br>
don't think of it like a line<br>
it is awareness

you are a be-ing<br>
you are a verb: awareness<br>
it requires time

mind: ones and zeros<br>
people believe in free will<br>
there's no evidence

a shiny surface<br>
it's not separate from you<br>
subject, object: one

you write what you know<br>
in fact, you are the writing<br>
nature is learning

if you will look deep,<br>
you will see Now is timeless<br>
change is illusion

wind ripples a pond<br>
boat shakes; you’re sitting in it<br>
you shake the pond, too

jump outside the box<br>
realize you're not just an ape<br>
you are the cosmos

look out the window<br>
you see the glass and outside,<br>
all through your body

the dropped pen is still<br>
have you forgotten it's you?<br>
written memories

automatic moves<br>
you suppose that you chose them<br>
nope; nature's choosing

stillness strategy:<br>
notice unconscious movements.<br>
proves nature is one.

separate ideas<br>
mathematical packets<br>
awareness is this

awaken to now<br>
ground yourself in this moment<br>
nothing is missing

a twist at the end<br>
turns out ideas never die<br>
you are an idea

reflections in glass<br>
quantumly entangled sight<br>
nothing is separate

camera takes your pic<br>
the you it took is no more<br>
static, core self: myth

math is what you see<br>
everything is tied to all<br>
division is myth

numbers make you up<br>
digital, not analog,<br>
means you never die

ideas work, or don't.<br>
packets of information<br>
replicate, or don't.

division seems real<br>
it is helpful in science<br>
arbitrary, though

anchored to nature<br>
sensation is what you are<br>
bundle of feelings

"woah", says the wise one<br>
"i see the body dissolve"<br>
"i'm a collection"

a patterned table<br>
your hand, with pen, rests atop<br>
out come nature's thoughts

change is bits flipping<br>
defocus; watch all at once<br>
be still and notice

you see the objects,<br>
but they're making you up,<br>
so you're the seeing

mind and body: one<br>
all science points to this truth<br>
nonduality

you're not body<br>
you're cosmos, meaning all's you<br>
nothing is separate

all of nature: mind<br>
your awareness makes up all<br>
math's not separate

pain, death: illusion<br>
does it hurt? yes. no one there.<br>
you're a collection

the flower, out there?<br>
no, all sensations are you,<br>
in you, to exist.

you can't kill numbers<br>
abstract quantities: timeless<br>
universe: numbers

lucy sits in tree<br>
contemplates life mystery<br>
"me: numbers: don't die"

time: necessary<br>
without change there is no thought<br>
illusion persists

i = numbers<br>
when i'm sleeping, nature sleeps<br>
calculations run

look upon the world<br>
notice there's no separateness<br>
mythic division

automatic thought<br>
demonstrates connectedness<br>
nothing besides you

stop breathing and look<br>
watch automaticity<br>
there is only One

nonduality<br>
mind and body: connected<br>
body-mind: nature

nonduality<br>
all nature's sensations: you<br>
math is connected

nonduality.<br>
simple. mind, body: one.<br>
nature is aware.

nonduality<br>
when you think, nature's thinking<br>
strange, but this math's true

you see things as far?<br>
what evidence do you have?<br>
you're those far things, too.

you are everywhere<br>
you just don't sense it like that<br>
body, Nature: One

poem moves the pen<br>
it squiggles for expression,<br>
wanting to be read

self-less consciousness,<br>
awareness without judgment,<br>
transcends fear and doubt.

you don't have to do.<br>
you are allowed to just be.<br>
be still and notice.

you are awake space<br>
the body is within you<br>
body dies, but not space

go even slower<br>
taste the moment's sensations<br>
feel you lack nothing

mind seeking to grow<br>
awareness seeks awareness<br>
memes make awareness

you are one with life.<br>
the sun is shining freely:<br>
life knows how to live.

time is illusion<br>
suffering dissolves in Now<br>
no judgment in Now

accept the What Is.<br>
don't give up, choose surrender.<br>
transcending tactic

there is a way out<br>
the truth can be seen by you<br>
decouple from self

if you remove self,<br>
the story dissolves, not you.<br>
sense of being lasts.

you are eternal<br>
you aren't the body; you're more<br>
body is in you

there's a bigger thing<br>
the body is in that space<br>
and it is awake

the world doth turn 'round<br>
sometimes you see it as flat<br>
other times: yourself

the bitter plant leaf,<br>
it can make your soul expand<br>
write, though: expand more

truthfully exist<br>
when you change you are growing<br>
you can be sans self

change from who you are<br>
accept what the moment holds<br>
suffering dissolves

when in doubt, stop fear<br>
end the control-illusion<br>
be eternity

stretching beyond time<br>
do you want to still the mind?<br>
forget the story

transcending the mind,<br>
an arisen awareness,<br>
to all of nature.

## [ungovern]

adam rises. creak.
headache and soreness. much pain.
daylight: half over.

time to get moving.
the future comes by helping.
shower is calling.

refreshed mind starts work.
his world: knowing energy.
who uses, who makes.

energy, matter:
one: E=mc^2
loss never happens

you make energy
simply by creating art
art is infinite

you use energy
when you observe others' art
always productive

nanotech robots
more powerful than you think
all pain: optional

bad experience
it can teach more than you think
so some "bad" is good

flip a switch: new game
what will this one make you think?
designed by artist

adam watches birds
inspiration in simple
see higher patterns

record the mindstate
adam's world: happening now
infinite future

upon button click
nanotech self-assembles
preprogrammed structure

eve: in adam's world
their names: a coincidence
yet, math's not random

random? perspective.
view can always be enlarged
reharmonizes

love's an emotion
mind, body: one; so, love: one
love: no separateness

the hospital sits
inside: cure for death's disease
fixable pieces

hard disk drives: old school
here: solid-state quantum drives
probabilities

cloak that bends the light
it hides you from direct sight
made invisible

mind on computer
adam's world: AIs are here
everyone is joined

all is connected
all minds are linked together
super-awareness

what's ungoverning?
ending compulsion to steer.
there's nothing to do.

beyond nanotech
creating universes
unlimited art

no evil AI
eternally combining,
we merge with all minds

eve wears bandana
sends a magnetic impulse
output sensations

bandana input
brain's electrical signals
Internet upload

creation: natural
destruction: temporary
becomes common sense

a great truth revealed:
all ending is illusion
there's only Growing

world without judgment
there is only the machine
one cohesive whole

<hr>

## [takeaways]

respect is earned
don't demand it from others
make yourself better

small deeds make great acts
so start now: one foot in front
keep on keeping on

nothing is easy
however, nothing is hard
perspective is all

i don't know myself
i keep trying to find out
i create to learn

use an hour a day,
on where you are and will go
this is for success

take the longer view
improve the distant future
effort gains purpose

a weed, once whacked,
is it truly still a weed?
perhaps in name only

the animal sees,
but does not look deep enough
there is more hidden

truly, you are aware,
yet you can always be more
do not forget this

be an open book
withholding ideas binds you
reveal to be free

to craft is to grow
you discover when you make
simply start writing

when the cup is filled
there is no need for more hope
yet hope is still there

desire, craving,
it is animalistic
try to rise above

four-dimensional:
it can be intuitive.
don't believe the doubt.

you look at the screen.
do you see a flat surface?
no, you see deeper.

the genius know depth;
they know knowledge is endless.
so they are dumb, too.

most apes, after money,
see not the point is wisdom.
wisdom makes you last.

wheels are invented
do not think of them as one
cars, and planes, use them

creation bears fruit
destruction is limited
cooperate: win

if there is no wind,
and if there is no sunlight,
still, life can prosper.

if you hold too tight,
then it will escape your grasp.
this math is proven

wisdom: limitless
yet also are fear and doubt
all can be useful

there's a trick to fear:
fear means it isn't happening
use this tip in life

it can be scary
yet know that you never die
math's unkillable

there are always paths
Gödel showed us this is true
there's no cap on math

try not to force things
sit back and think it over
knowledge is power

revision control
it's surprisingly helpful
turns back your mistakes

tired minds can help
different perspectives help
see it as useful

see higher natures
don't assume three dimensions
you aren't limited

to live is to dream
there's always sight beyond
focus your journey

the bucket has holes
this is not always bad news
things can get in, too

if you twist the truth,
your own mind will be twisty
let truth unravel lies

if you look around,
and really look, not just glance,
you'll see stories abound

pop news shares the bad
tech and science news, the good
pop news: bad for you

animals near you...
the friends you have make you up.
and you make them up.

a silver coin sits
is it money? you decide
always subjective

more than what is said
is in decoding itself
read between the lines

complexity math
unpredictability
everything's like this

the berry on plant
provides food. will provide shade.
start thinking long-term.

good wins in the end,
because it cooperates
replicates faster

mutation is key
natural selection is not
more ways to evolve

bad things make the news
unusual makes the news
good things: usual

do it in your head
you practice, you get better
in mind: run races

idea to absorb
phrase: "leave well enough alone"
'perfection' breaks things

soap drips from bottle
scrubbing wipes the virus off
more scrubbing: less death

reviewers hype show
IMDb lets me down
ignorance is bliss

the ocean is death
true, life requires water
yet, gill-less, we die

place for everything,
and everything in its place.
ordered mind is swift.

younger open mind
small push in wise direction
large compounding good

learning how to swim
first, learn floating and stillness
helpful life lesson

alcohol sickness.
wisdom comes at certain point.
limits are wisdom.

yes, this too shall pass.
worrying isn't helpful.
do what you can do.

savor every step
really taste the sensations
slow down and enjoy

passing messages
broken communication
still, we get things done.

abandon the path
realize there's something higher
think outside the box

letting go of space
you are not bound to Euclid
jump outside the box

a great time stares out
life's not a "thing"; it's process
journey is reward

purpose flux happens
don't be ashamed about it
past ideas are passed

the sharpie pen moves
ideas flow onto paper
transcendence happens

focus on the point
see nothing else but the point
let the mind dissolve

story isn't real
know: fiction is fictional
don't predict from fake

good haiku are good
ignore what's heard otherwise
they confine; you grow

quick pace needs fluid
thought must be allowed to stretch
such then leads to growth

the way out is up
let fear not conquer your mind
a wise strategy

a fear left alone,
is not a fear that lasts long
fear needs attention

a restful haiku
might poetry lend insight?
notice refreshing

trees move around land
new generation to move
think in bigger time

<hr>
