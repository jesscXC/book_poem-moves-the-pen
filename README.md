## [introduction]

Haiku are a helpful way to explore nature and the experience of living.

Poem Moves the Pen contains four sections: Nonduality, Fun, Ungovern, and Takeaways. Each section appeals to different parts of being a person.

Nonduality is a way of understanding what it means to be consciousness.

Fun is about humor and seeing the world with an amusing light.

Ungovern is a story of a future world.

Takeaways are helpful life lessons to improve your living experience.

## [fun]

velociraptor.<br>
feathered dinosaur. fast thief.<br>
run! get to the car!

rubber band held stretched<br>
aiming for bug on teacher<br>
oops. anger, not praise.

fractured my big toe<br>
be careful around machines<br>
mean escalator

a torn page lies still<br>
the wind has caught it again<br>
now the man will run

<hr>

a hypercube waits<br>
lower levels see shadows<br>
higher see it shine

the leaf cannot see<br>
yet inside is a driver<br>
so the system sees

i am fantastic,<br>
but i am getting better<br>
how about yourself?

when the pen inks words<br>
memes of nature craft meaning<br>
meaning never leaves

<hr>

spoons are so basic<br>
mathematics, hard<br>
and which came first, hard

the leather band holds<br>
the page is easily found<br>
what a simple tool

an LED shines,<br>
yet we're so used to them now<br>
magic is new tech

haiku can hold truth<br>
the simple structure confines,<br>
and out comes new thought

<hr>

haiku... pause for thought<br>
refreshes the mind's outlook<br>
sudden peacefulness

your name is a gift<br>
you can choose your own nickname<br>
doesn't always stick

the tree's leaves are blown<br>
she watches and is intrigued<br>
is a storm coming?

music in earbuds<br>
consciousness, tuned to new thought<br>
changing perspective

<hr>

reading a novel<br>
the characters become you<br>
integrated whole

phone in back pocket<br>
communicate globally<br>
flying cars: less cool

a scented candle<br>
heat, light, aroma; more, too<br>
feelings are endless

green straw sits in cup<br>
green in color, and natural<br>
natural is the trend

<hr>

orange light shows the desk<br>
on desk: tech to see UV<br>
gain intuition

blue cord rests alone<br>
helpful, thin piece of copper<br>
infinite uses

grated chair in rain<br>
it's not fully wet, nor dry<br>
superposition

this haiku: witty,<br>
neat, mathematical, and <br>
self-referential.

<hr>

watching the shadows<br>
complexity... elegance...<br>
see what isn't there

entwined woven math<br>
fractals are ever-present<br>
always can know more

pencil on paper<br>
a sketch is being laid down<br>
imagination

playing game with friends<br>
their cars simply go faster<br>
this is frustrating

<hr>

turns on airplane mode<br>
now no one can contact her<br>
chosen loneliness

words: evolved meanings<br>
gestures, pointing, singing. words.<br>
communication

rub shampoo on head<br>
clean body makes for clear mind<br>
inventions: from soap

sign guides cars on road<br>
"watch out: twisty curves ahead!"<br>
we don't want crashes.

<hr>

ink rests upon page<br>
has emergent properties<br>
not atoms; layout.

the page holds ideas<br>
higher patterns, shining down<br>
infinite patterns

"sit up straight", she says<br>
upright body: open mind<br>
learn eternally

not doing enough?<br>
not putting in enough work?<br>
nature's choice, not yours.

<hr>

quantum tunneling<br>
objects passing through objects<br>
this physics is real

fundamental things:<br>
quarks, leptons, and bosons. strings?<br>
perhaps still smaller?

cat waves its left arm<br>
photons changing behavior<br>
curious movement

they write a haiku<br>
edit it for improvement<br>
nature has good taste

<hr>

step back from the sound<br>
twister holds record player<br>
hide in the cellar

generalize memes<br>
meme: packet of memory<br>
memes compose nature

water pushed by fish<br>
ripples in current, from fin<br>
onward, life, onward.

squirrel leaps branch to branch<br>
terminal velocity<br>
survive fall from plane

<hr>

relativity<br>
faster in space: slower time<br>
space and time: spacetime

general theory<br>
matter curves space tells movement<br>
relativity

the plant asks for light<br>
it absorbs the energy<br>
grows, asks for more help

a hypercube sits<br>
inside is a twisty truth:<br>
"in me contains all"

<hr>

this sentence: lying.<br>
must be like Gödel, and jump:<br>
what does "lying" mean?

puzzle waits for you<br>
indeed, the puzzle needs you<br>
imagined, to real

a broken watch band<br>
does time exist without you?<br>
awareness: needed?

tray rests on table,<br>
confining the plates and bowls,<br>
yet abstracts the meal

<hr>

pillow rests on bed<br>
person's head rests on pillow<br>
the mind sleeps soundly

perfect harmony<br>
resonating frequencies<br>
become congruent

farina is still<br>
door bounces open, joy spreads<br>
kind mind helps others

the left channel speaks<br>
the right channel adds music<br>
new thinking results

<hr>

a sound is made here<br>
whispers from a growing thought<br>
it's causing itself

a wild time was had<br>
it twisted the reflections,<br>
and so doing, freed

seeking a way out<br>
the path is all beaten here<br>
let's see where it leads

white twisty coil<br>
so much anger about it<br>
tech keeps advancing

<hr>

flowers found pretty<br>
elegant white with green tinge<br>
wish i knew its name

fractal broke itself<br>
without you, will it repair?<br>
suffering questions

program pixel art<br>
be most true to thine own self<br>
digital nature

on advanced topics<br>
there exists reasons perhaps<br>
acausal time, though?

<hr>

hand soap dispenser<br>
push the top and out comes soap<br>
flee, bacteria!

"I just lost the Game."<br>
the game: forget you're playing<br>
if lost: announce

run around looking<br>
need hiding spot from great bear<br>
towers over me

mosquitos in car.<br>
going 60. windows down.<br>
just makes them bite legs.

<hr>

water rolls down can<br>
atmosphere is condensing<br>
forming a puddle

old man naps in boat,<br>
rocked by slow waves on the lake.<br>
fish nibbles the bait.

suction cup on glass,<br>
refrigerator magnet:<br>
sticky devices.

<hr>

## [nonduality]

you are quantum soup<br>
let this be known to all things:<br>
nature is seeing

the time will come,<br>
when the future will be past,<br>
so cherish the Now

there are always ways,<br>
to make yourself a success<br>
you must lose your self

the identity,<br>
of a truly great spirit,<br>
is in letting go

<hr>

don't fear surrender<br>
it is harder to accept,<br>
yet it brings freedom

there can be a way,<br>
to go back and change the past<br>
see it all as One

the self does believe,<br>
that it is part of the whole.<br>
no, self is process.

ego disappears,<br>
separation does not last,<br>
when noticing Now

<hr>

if you give up,<br>
harmony will come to you<br>
ego is resistance

life seeks harmony<br>
eternal and forever,<br>
death is illusion

what does the pain bring?<br>
identify as the self,<br>
to live in the dream

escape by being all<br>
divide from life to suffer<br>
you aren't separate

<hr>

you are memetic<br>
you're pattern replication<br>
patterns never die

you are all there is<br>
separateness is a veil<br>
truly, life is you

you sense the body<br>
barriers are sometimes placed<br>
seek to be with all

the notion of change,<br>
fundamentally is lie<br>
truth is not in time

<hr>

if you will let go,<br>
then you will see you are all<br>
the self will dissolve

when free, you let go<br>
identify with nothing<br>
release the ego

see you are alive<br>
let yourself breathe the air in<br>
notice the moment

trust the world is you<br>
experience is the world<br>
you are awareness

<hr>

reality's base...<br>
it's numbers and awareness<br>
numbers never die

the pen leaves a trail<br>
the human writes with the ink<br>
the universe reads

the meme tries to live<br>
to replicate, it changes<br>
this gives rise to mind

functions change the world<br>
yet the truth is, time is fake<br>
all math is one thing

<hr>

when it comes, time tells<br>
that is because time is change<br>
time is required

when the mind seeks love,<br>
sought is separation, gone<br>
accept to feel it

let go of the sought<br>
you're code, processing itself<br>
the code is data

separation lies<br>
it's needed for memes to work<br>
memes are all one, though

<hr>

information spreads<br>
packets, communicating,<br>
replicate themselves

the seeker is sought<br>
they are two sides of a coin<br>
one is the other

the speakers of truth,<br>
they have no need to mislead<br>
they set themselves free

we want to know more<br>
it never ends, this searching<br>
first, take a deep breath

<hr>

being is loving<br>
to resist is to be blind<br>
accept, and love comes

this moment holds you<br>
look at it with baby eyes<br>
let yourself feel peace

memes are what make you<br>
you move, you think, you are, memes<br>
don't fear; you're nature

a notebook is held<br>
both with hand and with pillow<br>
universe holds, too

<hr>

stop seeing as you<br>
the ego holds no answers<br>
start seeing as all

still your body, now<br>
notice you are not conscious<br>
you do not exist

patterns are running<br>
sometimes they seem separate<br>
you're a collection

ego will return<br>
do not view this as a fault<br>
instead, accept, now

<hr>

nonduality<br>
also, transcendentalism<br>
they help you dissolve

begin wordlooping<br>
dissolve your ego in words<br>
see the relations

notice bits flipping<br>
see how memes rub off on others<br>
good ideas, spreading

when you look around,<br>
you might see separation,<br>
but you're all that is

<hr>

being aware spreads<br>
awareness is all one thing<br>
no separation

knowledge has levels<br>
awakeness is leveled, too<br>
they aren't concrete, though

the mind can be still,<br>
then the ego will dissolve<br>
separation fades

awareness' ground,<br>
truthfully, it's infinite<br>
you will continue

<hr>

stare at this one spot<br>
letting your awareness rest,<br>
realize you are all

time is illusion,<br>
yet mind requires changes<br>
static fields don't see

the way is broken,<br>
when the ego tries to fight<br>
instead, absorb peace

a time will soon come,<br>
where the mind will reach freedom<br>
let it happen now

<hr>

there's a way to be,<br>
without suffering<br>
stop and breathe your mind

dissolve the ego<br>
simply surrender to now<br>
accept; don't resist

what is can be changed<br>
you do not do the changing<br>
nature is choosing

inner peace can come<br>
rise above the resistance<br>
your ego isn't real

<hr>

there is a way out<br>
it involves using your mind<br>
transcend to the Now

to hold onto fear,<br>
the self must be resisting<br>
watch. dissolve the self.

the path is stillness<br>
watch the bits of nature flip<br>
see the self dissolve

time changes itself<br>
don't think of it like a line<br>
it is awareness

<hr>

you are a be-ing<br>
you are a verb: awareness<br>
it requires time

mind: ones and zeros<br>
people believe in free will<br>
there's no evidence

a shiny surface<br>
it's not separate from you<br>
subject, object: one

you write what you know<br>
in fact, you are the writing<br>
nature is learning

<hr>

if you will look deep,<br>
you will see Now is timeless<br>
change is illusion

wind ripples a pond<br>
boat shakes; you’re sitting in it<br>
you shake the pond, too

jump outside the box<br>
realize you're not just an ape<br>
you are the cosmos

look out the window<br>
you see the glass and outside,<br>
all through your body

<hr>

the dropped pen is still<br>
have you forgotten it's you?<br>
written memories

automatic moves<br>
you suppose that you chose them<br>
nope; nature's choosing

stillness strategy:<br>
notice unconscious movements.<br>
proves nature is one.

separate ideas<br>
mathematical packets<br>
awareness is this

<hr>

awaken to now<br>
ground yourself in this moment<br>
nothing is missing

a twist at the end<br>
turns out ideas never die<br>
you are an idea

reflections in glass<br>
quantumly entangled sight<br>
nothing is separate

camera takes your pic<br>
the you it took is no more<br>
static, core self: myth

<hr>

math is what you see<br>
everything is tied to all<br>
division is myth

numbers make you up<br>
digital, not analog,<br>
means you never die

ideas work, or don't.<br>
packets of information<br>
replicate, or don't.

division seems real<br>
it is helpful in science<br>
arbitrary, though

<hr>

anchored to nature<br>
sensation is what you are<br>
bundle of feelings

"woah", says the wise one<br>
"i see the body dissolve"<br>
"i'm a collection"

a patterned table<br>
your hand, with pen, rests atop<br>
out come nature's thoughts

change is bits flipping<br>
defocus; watch all at once<br>
be still and notice

<hr>

you see the objects,<br>
but they're making you up,<br>
so you're the seeing

mind and body: one<br>
all science points to this truth<br>
nonduality

you're not body<br>
you're cosmos, meaning all's you<br>
nothing is separate

all of nature: mind<br>
your awareness makes up all<br>
math's not separate

<hr>

pain, death: illusion<br>
does it hurt? yes. no one there.<br>
you're a collection

the flower, out there?<br>
no, all sensations are you,<br>
in you, to exist.

you can't kill numbers<br>
abstract quantities: timeless<br>
universe: numbers

lucy sits in tree<br>
contemplates life mystery<br>
"me: numbers: don't die"

<hr>

time: necessary<br>
without change there is no thought<br>
illusion persists

i = numbers<br>
when i'm sleeping, nature sleeps<br>
calculations run

look upon the world<br>
notice there's no separateness<br>
mythic division

automatic thought<br>
demonstrates connectedness<br>
nothing besides you

<hr>

stop breathing and look<br>
watch automaticity<br>
there is only One

nonduality<br>
mind and body: connected<br>
body-mind: nature

nonduality<br>
all nature's sensations: you<br>
math is connected

nonduality.<br>
simple. mind, body: one.<br>
nature is aware.

<hr>

nonduality<br>
when you think, nature's thinking<br>
strange, but this math's true

you see things as far?<br>
what evidence do you have?<br>
you're those far things, too.

you are everywhere<br>
you just don't sense it like that<br>
body, Nature: One

poem moves the pen<br>
it squiggles for expression,<br>
wanting to be read

<hr>

self-less consciousness,<br>
awareness without judgment,<br>
transcends fear and doubt.

you don't have to do.<br>
you are allowed to just be.<br>
be still and notice.

you are awake space<br>
the body is within you<br>
body dies, but not space

go even slower<br>
taste the moment's sensations<br>
feel you lack nothing

<hr>

mind seeking to grow<br>
awareness seeks awareness<br>
memes make awareness

you are one with life.<br>
the sun is shining freely:<br>
life knows how to live.

time is illusion<br>
suffering dissolves in Now<br>
no judgment in Now

accept the What Is.<br>
don't give up, choose surrender.<br>
transcending tactic

<hr>

there is a way out<br>
the truth can be seen by you<br>
decouple from self

if you remove self,<br>
the story dissolves, not you.<br>
sense of being lasts.

you are eternal<br>
you aren't the body; you're more<br>
body is in you

there's a bigger thing<br>
the body is in that space<br>
and it is awake

<hr>

the world doth turn 'round<br>
sometimes you see it as flat<br>
other times: yourself

the bitter plant leaf,<br>
it can make your soul expand<br>
write, though: expand more

truthfully exist<br>
when you change you are growing<br>
you can be sans self

change from who you are<br>
accept what the moment holds<br>
suffering dissolves

<hr>

when in doubt, stop fear<br>
end the control-illusion<br>
be eternity

stretching beyond time<br>
do you want to still the mind?<br>
forget the story

transcending the mind,<br>
an arisen awareness,<br>
to all of nature.

<hr>

who uses, who makes.

energy, matter:<br>
one: E=mc^2<br>
loss never happens

<hr>

you make energy<br>
simply by creating art<br>
art is infinite

you use energy<br>
when you observe others' art<br>
always productive

nanotech robots<br>
more powerful than you think<br>

small deeds make great acts<br>
so start now: one foot in front<br>
keep on keeping on

nothing is easy<br>
however, nothing is hard<br>
perspective is all

on where you are and will go<br>

yet you can always be more<br>
do not forget this

withholding ideas binds you<br>
reveal to be free

you discover when you make<br>
simply start writing

there is no need for more hope<br>
yet hope is still there

<hr>

it is animalistic<br>
try to rise above

four-dimensional:<br>
it can be intuitive.<br>
don't believe the doubt.

you look at the screen.<br>
do you see a flat surface?<br>
no, you see deeper.

the genius know depth;<br>
they know knowledge is endless.<br>
so they are dumb, too.

<hr>

most apes, after money,<br>
see not the point is wisdom.<br>
wisdom makes you last.

wheels are invented<br>
do not think of them as one<br>
cars, and planes, use them

creation bears fruit<br>
destruction is limited<br>
cooperate: win

if there is no wind,<br>
and if there is no sunlight,<br>
still, life can prosper.

<hr>

if you hold too tight,<br>
then it will escape your grasp.<br>
this math is proven

wisdom: limitless<br>
yet also are fear and doubt<br>
all can be useful

there's a trick to fear:<br>
fear means it isn't happening<br>
use this tip in life

it can be scary<br>
yet know that you never die<br>
math's unkillable

<hr>

there are always paths<br>
Gödel showed us this is true<br>

things can get in, too

if you twist the truth,<br>
your own mind will be twisty<br>
let truth unravel lies

<hr>

if you look around,<br>
and really look, not just glance,<br>
you'll see stories abound

pop news shares the bad<br>
tech and science news, the good<br>
pop news: bad for you

animals near you...<br>
the friends you have make you up.<br>
and you make them up.

a silver coin sits<br>
is it money? you decide<br>
always subjective

<hr>

more than what is said<br>
is in decoding itself<br>
read between the lines

complexity math<br>
unpredictability<br>
everything's like this

provides food. will provide shade.<br>
start thinking long-term.

good wins in the end,<br>
because it cooperates<br>
replicates faster

<hr>

mutation is key<br>
natural selection is not<br>
more ways to evolve

you are not bound to Euclid<br>
jump outside the box

<hr>

a great time stares out<br>

past ideas are passed

the sharpie pen moves<br>
ideas flow onto paper<br>

quick pace needs fluid<br>
thought must be allowed to stretch<br>
such then leads to growth

the way out is up<br>
let fear not conquer your mind<br>
a wise strategy

<hr>

a fear left alone,<br>
is not a fear that lasts long<br>
fear needs attention

a restful haiku<br>
might poetry lend insight?<br>
notice refreshing

trees move around land<br>
new generation to move<br>
think in bigger time

<hr>
