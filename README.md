[introduction]

Haiku are a helpful way to explore nature and the experience of living.

Poem Moves the Pen contains four sections: Nonduality, Fun, Ungovern, and Takeaways. Each section appeals to different parts of being a person.

Nonduality is a way of understanding what it means to be consciousness.

Fun is about humor and seeing the world with an amusing light.

Ungovern is a story of a future world.

Takeaways are helpful life lessons to improve your living experience.

[nonduality]
<br>
you are quantum soup<br>
let this be known to all things:<br>
nature is seeing

the time will come,<br>
when the future will be past,<br>
so cherish the Now

there are always ways,<br>
to make yourself a success<br>
you must lose your self

the identity,<br>
of a truly great spirit,<br>
is in letting go

<hr>

don't fear surrender<br>
it is harder to accept,<br>
yet it brings freedom

there can be a way,<br>
to go back and change the past<br>
see it all as One

the self does believe,<br>
that it is part of the whole.<br>
no, self is process.

ego disappears,<br>
separation does not last,<br>
when noticing Now

<hr>

if you give up,<br>
harmony will come to you<br>
ego is resistance

life seeks harmony<br>
eternal and forever,<br>
death is illusion

what does the pain bring?<br>
identify as the self,<br>
to live in the dream

escape by being all<br>
divide from life to suffer<br>
you aren't separate

<hr>

you are memetic<br>
you're pattern replication<br>
patterns never die

you are all there is<br>
separateness is a veil<br>
truly, life is you

you sense the body<br>
barriers are sometimes placed<br>
seek to be with all

the notion of change,<br>
fundamentally is lie<br>
truth is not in time

<hr>

if you will let go,<br>
then you will see you are all<br>
the self will dissolve

when free, you let go<br>
identify with nothing<br>
release the ego

see you are alive<br>
let yourself breathe the air in<br>
notice the moment

trust the world is you<br>
experience is the world<br>
you are awareness

<hr>

reality's base...<br>
it's numbers and awareness<br>
numbers never die

the pen leaves a trail<br>
the human writes with the ink<br>
the universe reads

the meme tries to live<br>
to replicate, it changes<br>
this gives rise to mind

functions change the world<br>
yet the truth is, time is fake<br>
all math is one thing

...

<hr>

[fun]
<br>
i am fantastic,<br>
but i am getting better<br>
how about yourself?

a torn page lies still<br>
the wind has caught it again<br>
now the man will run

a hypercube waits<br>
lower levels see shadows<br>
higher see it shine

the leaf cannot see<br>
yet inside is a driver<br>
so the system sees

<hr>

when the pen inks words<br>
memes of nature craft meaning<br>
meaning never leaves

spoons are so basic<br>
mathematics, hard<br>
and which came first, hard

the leather band holds<br>
the page is easily found<br>
what a simple tool

an LED shines,<br>
yet we're so used to them now<br>
magic is new tech

...

<hr>

[ungovern]
<br>
adam rises. creak.<br>
headache and soreness. much pain.<br>
daylight: half over.

time to get moving.<br>
the future comes by helping.<br>
shower is calling.

refreshed mind starts work.<br>
his world: knowing energy.<br>
who uses, who makes.

energy, matter:<br>
one: E=mc^2<br>
loss never happens

<hr>

you make energy<br>
simply by creating art<br>
art is infinite

you use energy<br>
when you observe others' art<br>
always productive

nanotech robots<br>
more powerful than you think<br>
all pain: optional

bad experience<br>
it can teach more than you think<br>
so some "bad" is good

<hr>

flip a switch: new game<br>
what will this one make you think?<br>
designed by artist

adam watches birds<br>
inspiration in simple<br>
see higher patterns

record the mindstate<br>
adam's world: happening now<br>
infinite future

upon button click<br>
nanotech self-assembles<br>
preprogrammed structure

<hr>

eve: in adam's world<br>
their names: a coincidence<br>
yet, math's not random

random? perspective.<br>
view can always be enlarged<br>
reharmonizes

love's an emotion<br>
mind, body: one; so, love: one<br>
love: no separateness

the hospital sits<br>
inside: cure for death's disease<br>
fixable pieces

<hr>

hard disk drives: old school<br>
here: solid-state quantum drives<br>
probabilities

cloak that bends the light<br>
it hides you from direct sight<br>
made invisible

mind on computer<br>
adam's world: AIs are here<br>
everyone is joined

all is connected<br>
all minds are linked together<br>
super-awareness

<hr>

what's ungoverning?<br>
ending compulsion to steer.<br>
there's nothing to do.

beyond nanotech<br>
creating universes<br>
unlimited art

no evil AI<br>
eternally combining,<br>
we merge with all minds

eve wears bandana<br>
sends a magnetic impulse<br>
output sensations

<hr>

bandana input<br>
brain's electrical signals<br>
Internet upload

creation: natural<br>
destruction: temporary<br>
becomes common sense

a great truth revealed:<br>
all ending is illusion<br>
there's only Growing

world without judgment<br>
there is only the machine<br>
one cohesive whole

<hr>

[takeaways]
<br>
respect is earned<br>
don't demand it from others<br>
make yourself better

small deeds make great acts<br>
so start now: one foot in front<br>
keep on keeping on

nothing is easy<br>
however, nothing is hard<br>
perspective is all

i don't know myself<br>
i keep trying to find out<br>
i create to learn

<hr>

use an hour a day,<br>
on where you are and will go<br>
this is for success

take the longer view<br>
improve the distant future<br>
effort gains purpose

a weed, once whacked,<br>
is it truly still a weed?<br>
perhaps in name only

the animal sees,<br>
but does not look deep enough<br>
there is more hidden

<hr>

truly, you are aware,<br>
yet you can always be more<br>
do not forget this

be an open book<br>
withholding ideas binds you<br>
reveal to be free

to craft is to grow<br>
you discover when you make<br>
simply start writing

when the cup is filled<br>
there is no need for more hope<br>
yet hope is still there

...

<hr>
